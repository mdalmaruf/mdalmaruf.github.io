## Overview
In the realm of Cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety is paramount, particularly in dynamic environments where accidents or runway excursions can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The Aircraft Landing Detection Application stands as a beacon of innovation, utilizing data-driven, near real-time monitoring approaches to detect abnormal movements or risky aircraft landings by examining various parameters such as speed, deceleration, distance, and altitude. This project not only aims to preemptively identify potential risks but also to redefine the traditional methodologies of monitoring aircraft landings through a more sophisticated, real-time analytical lens, thereby significantly enhancing aviation safety.

## How It Works
The application harnesses a fusion of advanced sensors and bespoke algorithms to deliver real-time data analytics, offering a panoramic view of aircraft trajectories and landing events. By translating raw sensor data into actionable insights, the application empowers air traffic controllers to make informed, timely decisions, ensuring the safe and efficient management of air traffic, and mitigating the risks of runway incursions.
